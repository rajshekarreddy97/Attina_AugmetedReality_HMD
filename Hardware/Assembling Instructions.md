# Attina Assembly

The Attina headset is comprised of 3D printable parts, and their respective CAD models have been designed using CAD software. The individual parts in 3D printable format (.stl) are available here: https://github.com/rajshekarreddy97/Attina_AugmetedReality_HMD/tree/main/Hardware/3D%20Printing%20Files. Additionally, certain components required for assembling the AR headset are commercially available and their details can be found under the bill of materials section.

## Bill of Materials

## Tools Required for Manufacturing and Assembly

- 3D printer with a minimum bed size of 0.20 m x 0.15 m x 0.20 m (l x b x h).
- Screwdriver (flat head/star head) to fasten the components.
- Flat file to file the extended surfaces, and a sharp knife to trim off the plastic on the edges of the 3D printed parts, depending on print quality.

## Technical Specifications and Assembly Instructions

### Printing Instructions

- Print the main frame (Part A: IntelliVision_AR Headset_Main Frame_Mobile Holder.stl) in a vertical position (landing on its side face) to achieve maximum flexibility of the mobile holder clamp, which helps to hold the mobile device rigidly towards the reflector. The length of the frame is approximately 196 mm, and to accommodate this length, the printer's bed size should be a minimum of 200 mm moving in the Z-axis. This part requires additional support when printed in the vertical position. To save material, it is recommended to maintain more space between supports, and after printing is done, the part should be filed, and edges need to be trimmed wherever the surface is not smooth. Total printing time for the main frame is approximately 10 hours.
- Print the welding harness right and left (Part B: IntelliVision_AR Headset_Frame to Welding Harness Connector_Right.stl and Part C: IntelliVision_AR Headset_Frame to Welding Harness Connector_Left.stl) in an upright position without any support, with the letters on the welding harness facing upwards. Printing time: 2 hours
- Two locking screws (Part D: IntelliVision_AR Headset_Frame and Connector Lock Screw.stl) can be printed in a vertical position, starting from the head of the screw. Printing time: 20 minutes
- Print reflector holder (Part E: IntelliVision_AR Headset_Reflector Frame.stl) with a slot for fixing the reflector facing upwards. Printing time: 90 minutes
- Trim off the excess material and support from all the parts to smoothen the edges and surfaces. Cleaning time: 20 minutes.
- Total print and cleaning time may vary between 14 hours to 16 hours, depending on the filler diameter.

### Assembly Instructions

Please follow the steps illustrated below to assemble the parts.
